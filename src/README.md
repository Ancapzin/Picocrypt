Note: Picocrypt can use the <code>reedsolo</code> by itself, but it is very slow because it's pure Python. It is recommended to compile a Python extension (.pyd/.so) for <code>reedsolo</code>, and name it creedsolo (ie. <code>creedsolo.pyd</code> or <code>creedsolo.so</code>). The Windows executable already bundles creedsolo.pyd, but for Linux, you'll have to build the Python extension yourself if you want better speeds. Building the extension is not necessary if you don't intend on using the Reed-Solomon feature, or if you are okay with speeds ~1MB.
