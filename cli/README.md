# Installation
If you don't have Go installed, download it from <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">here</a> or install it from your package manager (`apt install golang-go`). The latest version of Go is recommended, although you may fall back to Go 1.19 should any issues arise in the future. Once Go is installed, run the command below:

```bash
go install github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt/cli/picocrypt@latest
```

You should now be able to run `picocrypt` in your terminal.
