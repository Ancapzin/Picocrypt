# Roadmap
Here's the road ahead for Picocrypt. Not all items listed will be added; they are simply possible new features. They're not in any particular order. Have suggestions? Create an Issue. Thanks!

# Under consideration
<ul>
	<li><strong>Patron request (higher priority)</strong>: Add to Fedora repos</li>
	<li>Get Picocrypt audited (<i>please donate</i> to help fund the audit)</li>
	<li>Add to AUR (Arch User Repo) (thanks u/blackrosae)</li>
	<li>Secure password/mnemonic generator</li>
	<li>Android/iOS support (thanks u/fzylqd), potentially via a web interface (thanks @Tutturuuu)</li>
	<li>Full disk encryption (thanks u/playffy)</li>
	<li>Tweakable Argon2 parameters (with lower bounds)</li>
	<li>Hidden volume like VeraCrypt (thanks u/greenreddits)</li>
	<li>Hardware keys (thanks u/Tech99bananas)</li>

<ul>
</ul>

# Completed (most recent first)
<ul>
	<li>Picocrypt has been ported from Python to Go, thus completely rewritten</li>

</ul>
