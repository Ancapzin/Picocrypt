# Translations
Are you fluent in another language? Help make Picocrypt more accessible to the world by translating the README into your language.

## I'm Adding a New Translation
Awesome. Simply fork this repository, add your translation, and submit a pull request. When adding your translation, you can use the raw markdown of the README as a template and simply translate the English strings within the document to your language. Be careful not to mess around with any of the formatting, links, or numbers. Other than that, good luck!

## A Translation Already Exists
Great. Now improve it! Since Picocrypt's translations are a community effort, they may contain a few errors here and there, and may also be slightly out-of-date. If you notice any of these things, you're encouraged to help fix them. Try to make the translation grammatically correct, naturally flowing, and consistent with the formatting of the README.
