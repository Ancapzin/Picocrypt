## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact me privately <a href="https://evansu.cc/#contacts">here</a>. I don't have any bounties available, but I will put your name on the homepage as a thanks. Please do not create an Issue or post the vulnerability publicly, as it could be exploited by a hacker. Thank you.
